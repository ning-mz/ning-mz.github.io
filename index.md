## About Me

I am currently a PostDoc at Duke Kunshan University, reporting to [Prof. Kaizhu Huang](https://sites.google.com/view/kaizhu-huang-homepage/home). In previous, I obtained my Ph.D. from the University of Liverpool in July 2025, supervised by [Prof. Qiufeng Wang](https://scholar.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/persons/QiufengWang), [Prof. Kaizhu Huang](https://sites.google.com/view/kaizhu-huang-homepage/home) and [Prof. Xiaowei Huang](https://cgi.csc.liv.ac.uk/~xiaowei/). I am also a member in the research group [PremiLab-Math](https://premilab-math.github.io), focus on solving math problems with AI. In the future, I will extend my research to Embodied AI.
